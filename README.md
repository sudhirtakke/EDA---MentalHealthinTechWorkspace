Exploratory data analysis on dataset of mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace

This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.

The notebook has observations with each step in order to explain thoroughly how to approach the data set. Based on the observation some questions also are answered in the notebook for the reference though not all of them are explored in the analysis.
